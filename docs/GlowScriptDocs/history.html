        <p class="Normal">2015 Dec. 21: Update of files that permit operator overloading (being able to add two vectors a and b simply as a+b) and the ability to use synchronous code (such as infinite loops)  thanks to files supplied by Salvatore di Dio. Changes to Firefox made this update necessary. An added bonus was that GlowScript now runs on Internet Explorer and Edge.</p>
        <p class="Normal">2015 Oct. 18: Implement display.delete(), gdisplay.delete(), and the ability to delete a set of data from a graph. Add to the make_trail machinery the ability to set trail_color and trail_radius without having to reference trail_object.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2015 Oct. 15: scene.mouse.pos now always contains the up-to-date mouse information, which makes it possible to drag objects with the mouse buttons up.</p>
        <p class="Normal">2015 Sept. 19: Implement the standard Python string.format mechanism.</p>
        <p class="Normal">2015 August 27: Improve sphere and curve rendering; provide textures.earth.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2015 August 2: Implement simple editor as alternative to the ACE editor, so that it is now possible to edit programs on mobile devices.</p>
        <p class="Normal">2015 June 23: Implement Python-style string formatting.</p>
        <p class="Normal">2015 June 3: Ring is now a regular primitive and supports transparency.</p>
        <p class="Normal">2015 April 21: Add factorial and combin functions.</p>
        <p class="Normal">2015 Feb. 22: Enable transparency on mobile devices.</p>
        <p class="Normal">2015 Jan. 20: Support touch inputs on touch-sensitive devices.</p>
        <p class="Normal">2014 November 17: Updated GlowScript 1.1 to fix a problem with JavaScript programs. This also introduces the ability to handle programs written in classic VPython, with some restrictions; see the <a href="../VPythonDocs/index.html" target="_blank">VPython Help</a>. There are  new vector capabilities such as dot(A,B), equivalent to A.dot(B). The curve object now has an attribute &quot;origin&quot; for moving the entire curve, relative to this origin.</p>
        <p class="Normal">2014 October 25: Released GlowScript 1.1. Support added for RapydScript, a Python look-alike, with much help from Alexander Tsepkov, Charles Law, and Salvatore di Dio. CoffeScript compiler updated, which among other things means that 3**4 now equals 81. Also, jquery and jquery-ui updated thanks to the work of Adam Thompson, who also added the ability to place print output to the right of the canvas and improved resizing of a canvas. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2012 October 10: Textures can now use images from other (&quot;CORS-enabled&quot;) web sites. GlowScript programs run well on the latest version of Firefox for Android (smartphones and tablets), though you can't yet rotate the camera, and transparency is buggy.</p>
        <p class="Normal">2012 September 12: Add functions compound_to_world, world_to_compound, pixel_to_world, print,  print_options, get_library, and read_local_file. Improve rate behavior for high rate values.</p>
      <p class="Normal">2012 August 21: Updated Version 1.0 to improve error reporting for both JavaScript and CoffeeScript programs, and to improve editing of CoffeeScript programs. Added to the Help sections on text output for debugging, and how to run GlowScript in the absence of an internet connection.</p>
        <p class="Normal">2012 May 30: Version 1.0 implements <strong>triangles</strong> and <strong>quads</strong>, based on <strong>vertex</strong> objects, which make it possible to design your own objects and even change their shape dynamically. Also new are <strong>compound</strong> (groups of objects that can be manipulated as though they were one object) and <strong>clone</strong> (make a copy of an existing object). David Scherer made major contributions to the design of these new features. Also, the <strong>curve</strong> object now permits rapid change of position, size, and orientation, and the array <strong>scene.objects</strong> now includes label objects. </p>
      <p class="Normal">2012 April 21: Now in version 0.7 you can write your program in CoffeeScript as well as in JavaScript. See the <a href="index.html">home page</a> for details.</p>
        <p class="Normal">2012 March 27: Transparency added to version 0.7. <span class="attributes">You can set the opacity of an object, with default = 1 (fully opaque); 0 is completely transparent.</span></p>
      <p class="Normal">2012 Jan. 29: Release GlowScript version 0.7. The major new capability is <a href="textures.html"><strong>textures</strong></a>, including bump maps (normal maps), for objects other than curves (and the curve-like objects helix and ring). Other new features include shininess, emissive, and scene.visible. Changes were made to require named arguments for object.rotate, vector.rotate, local and distant lights, and scene.mouse.project. Improved glowscript.org front page thanks to Tim Sherwood.</p>
        <p class="Normal">May/June 2011: David Scherer and Bruce Sherwood begin collaborating on implementing GlowScript, patterned on VPython but running in a web browser, exploiting the the new JavaScript/WebGL environment.</p>
